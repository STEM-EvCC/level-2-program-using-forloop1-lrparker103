# STEM103_Level3_1-ForLoop
Larry parker STEM 103 

Main:

Save 1 had issues with the printing of the firstline variable, had to use f"

Save 2 Had to google how to convert decimals to percents in python, f" is very useful also learned about .2f. (just saw the code in the "mycode not working section)

Save 3 got rid of print checks to reduce clutter.

Save 4 I tried to combine both mission_name and mission_ years into 1 list then use <2000 to sort but ran into int and tuple error, it may also require even more code to change the format. Going to just use for and if for the last part.
